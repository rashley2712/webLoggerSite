astro.js
========
A Javascript library for astronomy. 

The plan is to make a Javascript framework for astronomy analagous to [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy). There is a core Javascript function that deals with package management: astro.js. The aim is to keep this core small and people who make use of the library only need to load the packages they need rather than a massive library. This will mirror the structure/APIs of astropy where possible and within the limits of the language.
